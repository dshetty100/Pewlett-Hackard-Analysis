# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees at Pewlett-Hackard reach retirement age.

The goal therefore is:
- 1. To determine the number of retiring employees by title by creating a table that holds all the titles of current employees 
who were born between January 1, 1952, and December 31, 1955.

- 2. To identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program by creating a mentorship-eligibility table that holds 
all the current employees who were born between January 1, 1965, and December 31, 1965.

The analysis was performed using six CSV files that contained all the employee data at Pewlett-Hackard. 
The CSV files and the SQL queries for the analysis can be found at http://github.com/dshetty100/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis 
under the Data and Queries folders, respectively.
